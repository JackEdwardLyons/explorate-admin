/** Vuex Actions
 *
 * In more complicated apps, itâ€™s likely that you will need to perform some asynchronous actions that modify the state.
 * Vuex handles this with actions. They are defined on your state object as well, and are passed the entire state context,
 * which allows them to access getters and commit mutations. They are expected (but not required) to return a promise
 * indicating completion status.
